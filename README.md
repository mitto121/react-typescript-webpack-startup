You will also see any lint errors in the console.

ARun test and show converage on console. It is not implemented yet but I am planing to use Jest with enzyme to write test case and show coverage on console once test case get sucess.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
